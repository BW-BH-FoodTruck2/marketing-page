                <p>Every true "foodie" worth their salt knows that some of the best food in any city can be found on
                    food trucks - but
                    knowing when and where those trucks will be can be next to impossible, and discovering new ones
                    often relies on
                    word-of-mouth that is long on tales of delicious, but short on actual details. FoodTruck TrackR was

                    finding and eating at a food truck fast, easy and fun. <br/> <br/> Quickly see all of our Operator partners'

                    times, view photos,

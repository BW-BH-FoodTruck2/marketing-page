                <p>Every true "foodie" worth their salt knows that some of the best food in any city can be found on food trucks - but
                knowing when and where those trucks will be can be next to impossible, and discovering new ones often relies on
                word-of-mouth that is long on tales of delicious, but short on actual details. FoodTruck TrackR was designed to make
                finding and eating at a food truck fast, easy and fun. Quickly see all of our Operator partners' nearby food trucks that
                currently open, view their current real-time GPS location, know the scheduled arrival and departure times, view photos,
                read customer reviews and much more, all in our easy to use app. Try FoodTruck TrackR today, and enjoy the best food
                YOUR city has to offer.</p>
